Love it — you’ve shipped, you’ve got a Gumroad checkout, and the landing page looks clean. Here’s a punchy, no-fluff plan to boost discovery + sales, starting with the highest-leverage fixes.

## 1) Quick wins on the landing page (today)

* **Use a custom domain** (e.g., `disguisemyapp.com`) instead of `github.io` for trust, SEO, and easier directory submissions. GitHub Pages supports this in a few clicks. ([GitHub Docs][1])
* **Keep buyers on your page** with the **Gumroad overlay/embed** (modal checkout) so fewer people bounce to a new tab. Add the widget snippet to your page. ([Gumroad][2])
* **Add Product structured data (JSON-LD)** so Google can show rich results (price, name, etc.). Start with `Product`, include price `$5`, and link to the Gumroad offer. ([Google for Developers][3])
* **Add privacy-friendly analytics** (Plausible or GA4). Put the snippet in `<head>`; define a “Checkout Click” event on the Gumroad button to track conversion. ([Plausible Analytics][4])

*(I had a quick look at your page to tailor this.)* ([Kilik911][5])

## 2) Gumroad-side boosts (30 minutes)

* **Enable Discover + tags** inside Gumroad to get internal marketplace traffic; make sure ratings are visible and account is verified. ([Gumroad][6])
* **Turn on affiliates** (offer \~20–30%). Add creators by email; Gumroad handles payouts. ([Gumroad][7])
* **Track UTMs** from every link (PH, HN, Reddit, YouTube, etc.) via Gumroad’s Analytics → Links. ([Gumroad][8], [Gumroad][9])
* (Optional) Add **Meta/GA pixels** in Gumroad “Third-party analytics” for basic ad attribution. ([Gumroad][10])

## 3) List where Mac users actually look (this week)

* **AlternativeTo** — create a listing with “macOS, Privacy, Screen-sharing” tags. ([AlternativeTo][11])
* **MacUpdate** — submit your app (they still review new software). ([MacUpdate][12])
* **Softpedia** — classic directory; good for long-tail search. ([Softpedia][13])

## 4) Two launch spikes you can run any time

* **Product Hunt**: prep listing assets + “Maker comment”, then launch at 12:01 AM PT. Follow their guide to improve odds of getting featured. ([Product Hunt][14], [help.producthunt.com][15])
* **Show HN**: “Show HN: Disguise My App — hide personal apps during screen-share.” Add a technical backstory in the first comment and link the site. ([Hacker News][16], [Gist][17])

## 5) Creator outreach (ongoing)

Pitch small/mid YouTubers and writers who cover **macOS tips, privacy, remote work**. Give them a review build + affiliate link + short press kit (logo, screenshots, before/after GIF, 1-paragraph pitch). What to include in a press kit: story, facts, visuals, bios, contact. ([Shopify][18], [Prezly.com][19])

## 6) SEO content that actually ranks (publish 4 short guides)

Create a tiny “Guides” section on your site and link it from the hero.

* “How to **change app icons on macOS Sequoia** (and how to undo it)”
* “**Hide personal apps during Zoom/Teams screen-share** in 60 seconds”
* “**Professional-looking Dock** for client calls (templates included)”
* “Lockdown your desktop: **privacy checklist** before you present”
  Each post internally links to your download button. Add `Product` JSON-LD to the main page as above. ([Google for Developers][3])

## 7) Light paid tests (if budget allows)

\$10–\$20/day on **Google Search** for terms like “change app icon mac”, “hide apps during screen share mac”, “replace dock icons mac”. Use UTM for each ad group and kill anything with poor CPA after \~200 clicks. (Track via Gumroad UTMs.) ([Gumroad][8])

## 8) Bundles & deal sites (good for bursts + reviews)

Apply to **BundleHunt** or run a limited-time bundle to seed ratings and word-of-mouth (you can raise price later). ([bundlehunt.com][20])

## Your 30-day checklist

**Week 1**: custom domain → Gumroad overlay → Product JSON-LD → analytics + UTM → enable Discover & affiliates. ([GitHub Docs][1], [Gumroad][2], [Google for Developers][3], [Plausible Analytics][4])
**Week 2**: list on AlternativeTo, MacUpdate, Softpedia; publish 2 guides; add a press kit page. ([AlternativeTo][11], [MacUpdate][12], [Softpedia][13], [Shopify][18])
**Week 3**: Product Hunt or Show HN launch; run \$10/day search ads with UTMs. ([Product Hunt][14], [Hacker News][16], [Gumroad][8])
**Week 4**: Creator outreach (affiliate links), consider a BundleHunt submission. ([Gumroad][7], [bundlehunt.com][20])

If you want, I can:

* generate the **JSON-LD block** for your current page,
* give you the **exact overlay snippet** using your Gumroad product URL,
* and write **two SEO guide drafts** to publish right away.
